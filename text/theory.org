DV: survival or abandonment of cognitive labels used by audiences. 

Mechanisms: 
- Conceptual informativeness or distinctiveness. -> using the musicological features of songs.  
- Distinctiveness: Piazzai approach. MDS of features. Songs. Spherical space. 
- Informativeness: hierarchical concept. nature of the relations among concepts. 
- Audience niche size. 
- Audience composition: avant-garde or mainstream. 
- Status: average Billboard. Label could be more widely applied in aesthetic and social space. Expansion of use of genre labels due to increased popularity.
- Density measures. 
- Legitimation= same as status. 
- Rapid adoption could lead to abandonment. 

Methodological:
- assymmetry: 
- identification of genre-labels
- nature of the relations among concepts. 
- how tightly connceted the audiences are? two-mode not well connected individual listeners. 
- length of the time period. 
- Billboard. 


** own notes
unit of analysis is concept -> start with concepts

ecological 

add stuff about partiality 
- mean
  - high: salient
  - low: peripheral
- skew:
  - high: concentration
  - low: equality

can there be low mean but high skew? 

theoretical implications: 

*** fuzziness
concept (fruit) is fuzzy if there are objects (olive) of which it is not clear whether it belongs or not

classical category: just 100s (rest 0s)
somewhat fuzzy: many 100s, some non 100s

very fuzzy: many non 100s

the lower the average weight, the fuzzier the category? t

electronic: will be more fuzzy than syncwave-electrofunk
but that's accurate isn't it? 
people who use a very specific label know it well, have clearer criteria -> can make membership more binary

*** informativeness
needs hierarchy!!!

average informativeness?

need way to formalize informativeness from asymmetric competition coefs

hierarchy is a way to deal with asymmetry
Tversky thinks so too: [[cite:Smith_1981_categories][p.118]]

make the use more the improvisations (Bourdieu) -> stresses flexibility

*** other areas of concepts: 
- psychology
- neurophysiology
- information science

*** how to frame contribution
- more complete view of concepts
- different mechanisms (conceptual, audience, status)

# """classification systems (sensemaking) are crucial for social order, action"""

# namedrop meaning, interpretation, framing

Classification systems are essential for social life parencite:Durkheim_2019_primitive. 
# 
Without conceptual systems to aid in sense-making and generalization of experience, the complexity of perception would be overwhelming. 
# 
Interpretive frameworks that precede action and perception are hence crucial for structuring virtually all domains of social life (e.g. cite:Powell_1991_introduction,lamont1992money,Zuckerman_1999_illegitimacy,Fligstein_2017).
# 
The importance of cognition for social action can thus hardly be overstated. 
# 
Recently, parencite:Pontikes_2012_coin has explicitly highlighted the importance of informal, or practical classification systems. 
#
While these are characterized by a low degree of formal institutionalization, they can nevertheless be decisive. 
#
A focus on concepts that people use in their everyday life is hence needed in addition to an account of formally established categories.

*** overview :ignhead:
# 
I will focus here primarily on the structure of classification systems, that is to say the components -- concepts -- as well as the relations between these concepts. 
# 
In particular, I describe the historical developments of concept scholarship (primarily based on secondary literature), which leads me to characterize the prototype/schema model as the preferable approach for the current purpose of constructing a practical classification system. 
# 
As a contrast, I discuss a geometric probabilistic model recently proposed by textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts. 
# 
By making the various implicit theoretical assumption explicit, I argue that this model is of limited plausibility. 



** The classical view
# """introduces classical view: definitions, hierarchy"""

# is bluerprint actually a good metaphor? quite technical/precise/exact, qute unlike fuzzy probability distributions
# alternatives: template, matrix (too technical), schema/scheme? 
# feature is that it is used to produce things; is abstraction

# mention cite:Strauss_1997_cognitive: symbolic/classical/Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence vs connectionist 
# what are specific criticisms not covered by Murth/Smith? 


# distinguish 
# - storage
# - processing: categorization, inference
# - learning/acquisition: not really important here me thinks: could put it into suggestions for further research

# Given
# - logocentrism (Derrida)
# - bureaucratization/iron cage 
#   - narrow down to institutional logic? 

In everyday life, it may seem intuitive to think that concepts adhere to a unambiguous and internally coherent structure. 
# 
We (think we) aim for clear definitions of the objects or situations we encounter, and the extensive accounts we can produce to justify a choice in favor of one possibility vis-a-vis another (such as the comparison of two products) may give us the impression that we have grasped the essence of things. 
# (~it certainly seems to an extent be the prevailing worldview in formal education systems~) . 
# 
This general idea of well-orderedness is what textcite:Smith_1981_categories and textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts call the "classical view". 
# 
It is argued that it not only constitutes a lay understanding of concepts, but was the established paradigm in the psychology of concepts until the 1970s. 
# 
The classical view can be characterized by a general view of clear, logical structure. 
# 
Primarily, it argues that concepts are /definitions/ which can be clearly defined with a list of necessary and/or jointly sufficient features. 
# 
For example, one might consider the argument of textcite:popper1971conjectural to consider falsifiability as the demarcation criterion between science and non-science. 
#  
Inspired by set theory, a necessary consequence of this assumption is to view category membership as clear cut:
# 
Objects are either complete members of categories, or they are not members at all. 
# 
In turn, this assumes that all objects that exactly fulfill the membership conditions are equally good members [[parencite:Murphy_2004_concepts][p.15]]. 
# 


** The probabilistic view

textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts argues that the classical view has received criticism to an extent that they it has been abandoned or heavily reformulated. 
# 
Most fundamental is the question whether concepts have a central core that can be accurately captured by a definition. 
# """Wittgenstein quote: no clear definitions possible"""
In this regard, textcite:Wittgenstein_1968_investigations argues that while we have an understanding of what the concept of "game" entails, there is no precise definition of them in terms of necessary or sufficient features: 

#+begin_quote
If you look at [board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on] you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities and relationships [...] Look for example at board-games, with their multifarious relationships. Now pass to card-games; here you find many correspondences with the first group, but many common features drop out, and others appear. When we pass next to ball-games, much that is common is retained, but much is lost. Are they all 'amusing'? Compare chess with noughts and crosses. Or is there always winning and losing, or competition between players? Think of patience. In ball games there is winning and losing; but when a child throws his ball at the wall and catches it again, this feature has disappeared. Look at the parts played by skill and luck; and at the difference between skill in chess and skill in tennis. Think now of games like ring-a-ring-a-roses; here is the element of amusement, but how many other characteristic features have disappeared! And we can go through the many, many other groups of games in the same way; can see how similarities crop up and disappear. And the result of this examination is: we see a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail. (p.31)
#+end_quote

Following Wittgenstein's argument in regard to inability to clearly define a game in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts and textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts argue that concepts are fuzzy and entail blurry boundaries. 
# 
It might be noteworthy to point out that such impossibility to clearly define a concept is not confined to the realms that attempt to make sense of social action. 
# 
As these blurry boundaries are a feature of classification systems generally, they also occur in technical domains such as the planethood of Pluto, or the classification of polyhedras parencite:Lakatos_2015_proofs. 
# 
Similarly, the idea of falsifiability as the demarcation criterion between science and non-science has been criticized. 
# 
textcite:Kuhn_2012_structure considers the presence of a paradigm crucial but given the complexity of a paradigm which consists of metaphysical principles, assumptions, instruments and established practices parencite:chalmers2013thing a much greater range emerges on what can count as science. 
# 
textcite:Feyerabend_1993_method completely foregoes the attempt to define science. 

# ~One might argue that it is possible to construct crisp definitions in some cases~. 
# - square: 4 sides of equal length, 4 90% degree angles
# - bird: flies and feathered
#   but that is not exhaustive: everything that flies and is feathered is a bird, but not every bird flies and is feathered
#  focus is on concepts -> strong refusal 

# people list attributes that are not essential
# - bird flies
# - vehicle wheels, hovercraft

 
**** probabilistic 2 WORK WORK :ignhead:
# """typicality, graded membership, MODEL??"""
# prototype, exemplar, holistic ? schema? 
Furthermore, the abandonment of crisp boundaries does not entail the adoption of an arbitrary 'postmodern' 'anything-goes' approach (or more precisely a caricature thereof). 
# 
Rather, the proper reformulation of crisp boundaries is through a probabilistic specification of concept-feature relations and category membership, which leads textcite:Smith_1981_categories to call it the /probabilistic view/. 
# 
Rather than having an essence that can be grasped with a clear definitions, concepts are seen to acquire their meaning through relations to features. 
# 
No single feature (or combination of features) is decisive, but it is rather the multiplicity of features associated to varying degrees that constitute the meaning of a concept. 
# 
Central to the establishment of this perspective was the research of textcite:Rosch_1975_family, who found that instead of clear-cut membership, items vary in the degree of membership.
# 
The variations in membership, also termed degree of (proto-) /typicality/ can be seen in the case of fruit. 
# 
While apples and oranges are very typical members of the category fruit, blueberries and lemons are rated as less typical, and tomatoes and olives are given the lowest typicality ratings. 
# 
However, the existence of graded memberships does not in itself provide an alternative model of concept structure that can replace the view of concepts as definitions. 

# expand on FEATURES leading to high typicality judgement
# could use Smith/Medin (all items similar to ~fruit~ category) -> lead into network as model: this raises the so-far overlooked question how concept storage is structured

# network structure here? 
# network as general structure, metric space as exception that still fulfills all conditions? 
# fits better with idea of feature overlap

** Prototypes, Exemplars, Schemas 
**** concept structure :ignhead:
In this regard, textcite:Smith_1981_categories and textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts distinguish primarily between /prototype/ theories and /exemplar/ theories. 
# 
According to /prototype/ theory, concepts are generalized abstractions of features, which given the probabilistic framework that replaced the classical view, can vary in the degree to which they are associated with the concept.
# 
For example, the feature of sweetness may be a highly influential one for the concept of fruit, that of size might be moderately important, and the thickness of the peel might only have limited influence. 
#
/Exemplar/ theory however argues sees concepts as collections of objects. 
# 
Each encounter with an object is stored, resulting in large list of objects experiences to which new instances are compared. 
# 
Typicality effects can then be explained as frequent encounters with the items (such as apples and oranges) which are labeled as fruits so that new encounters of these are judged as typical. 
#
Recently, textcite:Murphy_2016_exemplar has argued that prototype theory is more adequate in regards to explain phenomena such as conceptual hierarchies (which will be elaborated further), knowledge and induction; I therefore use it primarily. 
# 


**** schema :ignhead:

It is however also relevant to also elaborate a particular specialization of it.  
# 
The basic prototype view is that prototypes are unstructured lists of features. 
# 
However, it can be seen that features are not necessarily completely unrelated: 
# 
The color of a typical fruit can be red or orange, but not both at the same time.
# 
Such features are mutually exclusive and are present in a range of cases, such as size (an object cannot be both tall and small) or sound (loud vs quiet). 
#
To capture such variation, textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts proposes the /schema/ view, a specialization of the prototype view. 
# 
In this view, a concept has a number of dimensions (or slots) for each dimension of mutually exclusive values on which all possible values are weighted by typicality. 
# 
For example, the "color" slot of the concept of fruit displays the highest values for bright colors such as red or yellow whereas darker colors like green or brown receive lower values. 


**** probability distribution :ignhead:
This notion of typical values can be captured more precisely through the concept of a /probability distribution function/, which specifies the typical probability for each position on a slot (In the case of discrete dimensions such as color, sometimes the term probability /mass/ function is used instead, albeit I refer here to both interchangeably). 
# 
While the name "probability distribution" is not used frequently, the notion it describes is very familiar. 
# 
In general, it does exactly what it says, namely describing the distribution of probabilities over a dimension (or possibly also over a space). 
# 
The most well-known probability function is presumably the normal distribution, the bell shape of which specifies a concentration of the probability mass around the mean which  symmetrically and monotonically thins out as one approaches the tails. 
# 
With its clear definition, it can for example be said that ~95% of the observations fall within two standard deviations from the mean, and over 99% within three standard deviations. 
# 
While such /parametric/ probability distributions are very precise, there is no guarantee that the empirical probability distributions of typicality positions of a dimension adhere to such strict criteria. 
# 
However, they maintain the feature of probability distributions generally, namely that they sum up to 1. 
# 
A complete /schema/ can therefore be conceptualized as a collection of probability functions which for each slot describe typical values[fn::the question whether concept properties are predominantly binary features or continuous dimensions is discussed by [[parencite:Smith_1981_categories][p.120]], who argue that in most cases but not all  binary features are used.].




** Relations between Concepts
*** Hierarchical Relations 
**** Hierarchical Relations: tree structure bad :ignhead:
# add references? 
Concepts are not just relevant in terms of their features, but also in terms of their relation to other concepts (I will for now focus on concepts as prototypes, i.e. feature lists; the elaboration relations between schemas needs further work). 
#
One way in which concepts can be considered to be linked is by their degree of abstraction:
# 
"Animals" for example refers to a much more general category than does "mammals", while "dogs" and "cats" are even more specific concepts. 
#
What is however less obvious is the relations between these concepts at different levels of abstraction. 
# 
The example of a species taxonomy shows a well ordered hierarchical structure that represents a tree parencite:Collins_1969_retrieval. 
# 
In such a model, a general concept stem branches out into a few sub-concepts, which in turn are the basis for even more fine-grained twig-like concepts. 
#
At each level, a concept has one (and only one) superordinate concept from which it inherits features.
# 
Category memberships is therefore transitive as all dogs and cats are both mammals well as animals, and all mammals are animals. 
#
Furthermore, there is no "cross-branching" between once separated concept links as no "cat" is also a member of the "fish" category. 
# 
An valuable contribution of this perspective is its ability to explain the location of feature values. 
#
In particular, it posits that features are only stored at the level of abstraction for which they are relevant, and "passed down" the branches. 
# 
For example, it argues that we do not need to store the feature "is alive" for every animal we have a concept of separately, but that the "is alive" feature is stored only once in a general "animal" class which all specific animal concepts inherit. 
#
However, this model has the substantial requirement of explicitly stored links between different levels to allow concepts to retrieve features of their superordinates. 
# 
While such hierarchical structure is a computationally efficient way of storing information, it is also very rigid, which raises the question if such a structure would be flexible enough for everyday uses. [fn::The scholars most associated with the taxonomic feature structure, textcite:Collins_1969_retrieval seem to have been aware of the limited applicability of the strictly hierarchical conceptualization (p.242, also see [[textcite:Quillian_1966_memory][p.6]] and [[textcite:Quillian_1988_memory][p.88]]). However this has not prevented scholars both approving parencite:Hannan_2019_concepts and disapproving parencite:Sloman_1998_tree,Steyvers_2005_structure,Murphy_2004_concepts from characterizing the tree model as a /general/ model of conceptual structure. It seems to me that such characterization might be motivated by different topics of interest, such as explicitly institutionalized classification systems in the former contrasted against flexible categorization in everyday life in the latter.]
#

# caution is advised in the judgment of how far such well-orderedness is generally applicable

**** computational :ignhead:
textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts in particular provides two main reasons against explicitly stored hierarchical linkages. 
# 
First, typicality effects are present in hierarchical links as well (p.208). 
# 
Judgments for typical items are generally stronger or faster, whether they concern membership ("a robin is a bird" is evaluated faster as "a penguin is a bird") or feature inference ("birds have an ulnar artery, therefore robins have an ulnar artery" is rated more believable as "birds have an ulnar artery, therefore penguins have an ulnar artery"). 
#
Secondly, transitivity violations give raise doubts to how strictly membership is passed downwards the branch: 
#
While respondents agree that seats are furniture, and car seats are seats, they deny that car seats are furniture (p.207). 
#

**** overlap :ignhead:
Due to these arguments that question the existence of stored explicit links between different levels of abstraction, he argues that instead hierarchical relationships are /computed on the spot due to feature overlap/ (p.207). 
#
In this line of reasoning, concepts are considered in a hierarchical relationship (or generally similar) if the feature set of the the more general concept form a /subset/ of the more specific one. 
#
This may at first seem unintuitive, but is in fact plausible when considering that more features imply higher specificity. 
# 
The concept of mammals, for example, is characterized by more detailed features than the more general concept of animals. 
 

**** overlap 2 :ignhead:
While this approach does away with the cognitive economy of a hierarchical order in which features are stored only once (concepts cannot inherit values from superordinates as superordinates are computed from feature overlap), it provides the flexibility to arbitrarily juxtapose concepts. 
# 
Feature overlap can then explain the phenomena that pose problems for the pre-stored view: 
#
As robins are more typical birds than penguins, inferences between the a typical concept and its superordinate flow easier as it resembles the prototype stronger than an atypical one. 
# 
Similarly, while car seats share some features with furniture and some with car seats, car seats and furniture do have a substantial feature overlap, resulting in the rejection of membership of the former in the latter. 



**** semi-lattice :ignhead:
# 
Adopting a computational view also loosens the requirement of the tree structure of only one parent per concept. 
# 
The approach suggested by textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts to model conceptual networks networks as semi-lattices (p.68) seems to be promising as it allows cross-branching (the fact that the authors are critical of the computational view and see themselves aligned more with the Quillian perspective (p.54) does not diminish the value of this suggestion). 
#
Concepts can therefore be members of multiple superordinates, in the case of which they constitute hybrids, such as romantic comedy which in the example of films, is both a member of genre "romance" and the genre "comedy". 

*** Relations at equal level

**** asymmetry :ignhead:
The consideration of feature overlap do not have implications for hierarchical relations, but to relations between concepts more generally. 
# 
In particular, /asymmetry/ is not limited to hierarchical relations, which cannot be symmetric as a concept can not be both subordinate and superordinate to another concept at the same time. 
#
Yet given the general mechanism of feature overlap, judgments are also not necessarily symmetric between concepts at the /same/ level. 
#
textcite:Tversky_1977_similarity finds for example that North Korea is rated more similar to China than China is to North Korea (or Poland more similar to the USSR than vice versa, or an ellipse more similar to a circle than the other way around). 
# 
From a perspective of feature overlap perspective it means that the variant North Korea can be better resembled by the prototype China than vice versa. 
# 
Additionally, /triangle inequality/ is not necessarily adhered: 
# 
With symmetric distances, the distance between two points can not be larger than sum of distances of both to a third point. 
# 
In the case of feature overlap, this does not hold, which textcite:Tversky_1977_similarity shows in the case of Jamaica, Cuba and Russia. 
#
Jamaica and Cuba are rated fairly similar due to their common feature of being located in the Caribbean, as are Cuba and Russia due to their (at the time) shared political system. 
# 
Jamaica and Russia however are not considered similar at all, and in particular are more distant than the sum of distances between Jamaica and Cuba and Cuba and Russia. 
#

**** concept represenation implications ~not clear if relevant~ :ignhead:
These considerations have substantial implications for the models used to represent concepts. 
#
They can for example hardly be represented as points in a metric space, as this form of representation assumes symmetry and 
triangle inequality parencite:Tversky_1977_similarity.
#
However, concepts as feature lists (prototypes) or probability distributions over dimensions (schemas) do not imply metric spaces [[parencite:Smith_1981_categories][p.105]]. 
# 
Rather than succumbing to the temptation of constructing a (seemingly parsimonious) feature space, "features [and dimensions] are to be compared on a component-by-component basis [...] What will not work is a process that compares concepts by computing metric distances between them." (ibid, p.129).
# 
Nevertheless, the idea of representing concepts in metric space has not been completely abandoned. 
# 
In the remaining section I will evaluate a recent attempt in this direction. 


** Probabilistic Metric Spaces
# 
An alternative approach of the structure of concepts has been developed by textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts. 
# 
Central to this idea is the concept of the /feature space/ -- a metric space of the features or dimensions. 
# 
As the authors do not give an account of their motivation, it is unclear why a geometric model has been given such priority. 
# 
textcite:Smith_1981_categories has argued that a "major virtue of current metric representations is their use of simple visual displays to make relations between concepts transparent" (p.114), but can intuitiveness be so influential, in particular if the additions to make the geometric model decently plausible also result in a complete lack of intuitiveness? 
# 
Another explanation might be that general compatibility with prominent studies that used metric spaces such as textcite:Ruef_2000_emergence was desired. 
# 
Additionally, the presence of Blau spaces in ecological paradigms parencite:McPherson_1983_affiliation which at least some of the authors are affiliated with might be partly explain the strong preference for conceptual spaces (while I have become "wary of metric representations" [[parencite:Smith_1981_categories][p.129]] my exclusive focus on concepts does not allow  me to evaluate their appropriateness in other domains). 
#
Whatever the motivations may have been the requirement of a probabilistic model can be shown to lead to assumptions that are theoretically rather implausible as well as very unparsimonious which, in the realm of limited cognitive resources, not necessarily but typically links to diminished plausibility. 

# Anecdotally, I remember that when I first started reading about concepts their positioning within a metric space seemed without alternative and taken-for-granted; they do certainly constitute an effective form of representing some forms of data. 



# The authors lament that a interpretation of "[typicality judgments] as distances in a semantic space seems not to have affected subsequent developments" (p.16). 
# #
# Interested in a geometric model, they aim for a "recasting of the Rips-Schoben-Smith parencite:Rips_1973_semantic model in probabilistic form" (ibid.).
# #
# In the preface, the authors cite as their inspiration of non-probabilistic geometrical models of textcite:Gardenfors_2014_geometry,Gardenfors_2004_spaces and textcite:Widdows_2004_geometry. 
# # 
# While geometric models may be preferred due to their simplicity, 

# it seems to me that the insistence of a spatial model that can account for key concepts phenomena entails substantial costs with very few benefits. 
# 

# 
# The choice of metric spaces is not justified so one can only speculate why a metric representation of concepts received such central importance within this project. 
# # 
# # 
# There is no doubt that the multidimensional scaling solution of concepts such as those by textcite:Rips_1973_semantic that textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts refer to as inspiration convey a certain kind of order in an intuitive fashion, but can this intuitive plausibility really explain such an influential decision? 
# 





**** key features of metric spaces :ignhead:
It is first necessary to clearly point out the specificities of a geometric approach. 
#
Whereas the previously discussed prototype and schema approaches treat the components, be they discrete features or continuous dimensions, as separate from each other, the geometric approach assumes that each component constitutes a dimension of a metric space. 
# 
The geometric approach has traditionally then located concepts as /points/ in the space, which gives an intuitive understanding of which concepts are similar (as they are grouped together) as well as which are dissimilar (distant). 
#
Furthermore, some spaces (primarily those constructed from pairwise similarity judgments) allow to interpret the dimensions of the spaces. 
# 
Ideally, this provides an intuitive understanding of the underlying features, such as the sorting of birds in terms of size and ferocity parencite:Rips_1973_semantic. 


**** Tversky kills metric spaces with facts and logic :ignhead:
One might wonder why geometric models have not been endorsed in the psychology of concepts. 
# 
While I cannot give a definite answer, it seems to me that textcite:Tversky_1977_similarity has effectively killed this approach with the findings that distances between concepts are asymmetric and do not adhere to triangle inequality. 
# 
However, one might still think that a probabilistic approach can salvage the metric model. 
# 
This might be in particular plausible as criticism of metric spaces has in fact often been limited to those models that conceptualize concepts as /points/ parencite:Steyvers_2005_structure,Smith_1981_categories. 
# # 
# A probabilistic account that would refrain from concepts as points might and adopts the idea of concepts as probability densities over the feature space might hence provide a plausible model. 
# 
# While operationalizations that assume symmetric distances and triangle inequality adherence such Latent Semantic Analysis are still in use, my hunch is that they rather are used as imperfect measurement tools, not theoretical models. 
# 
# A new kind of measurement that better respects the features of concept relations has also emerged in the form of topic modeling parencite:Griffiths_2007_representation,Griffiths_2019_probabilistic. 

**** example :ignhead:
How does a probabilistic recasting of metric space models look like? 
# 
If we start with imagining a concept with 5 binary features the differences between the approaches become apparent. 
# 
In a traditional metric model this concept would have been a point. 
# 
However in the probabilistic recasting it is seen now as a (hyper-)volume within the feature space (using the instances of the concept would imply an exemplar model; I am therefore focusing here on how a prototype or schema model would be distributed). 
# 
Since the features are binary, the space is split into "cells" of feature combinations over which the concept is defined as a probability distribution. 
# 
For example, 10% of the probability mass may be located in cell (1,1,1, 0,0), 5% in cell (1,1,0,0,1) and so on. 
# 
Crucially this approach entails that a concept is now operationalized as its feature /combinations/: 
# 
A feature does not matter on its own anymore, but only in combination with the other features. 


*** The inescapability of feature combinations 
textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts discusses the possibility feature combinations (p.118). 
# 
# First however he urges to keep in mind the distinction between correlation of features that is provided by prototypes and the direct use of feature correlation as concept properties. 
# # 
# The former is illustrated in the case of birds: If we know that an animals has a beak, wings and lives in a nest it is more likely that it migrates in the winter than if it has paws and lives in a burrow. 
# #
# Features, especially those that load highly on their respective concepts, co-occur in the items of the category and are hence correlated. 
# # 
# The latter implies that the correlation between features is used in addition to the features individually. 
# # 
In his review of the literature, he finds little influence of these in the case of natural concepts: 
# 
While some features that are not highly typical (such as "sings" and "small" for birds) are correlated, the presence of the correlation has no effect on typicality judgments beyond individual features, nor does its absence decrease typicality values parencite:Malt_1984_correlated.
# 
Correlations between features are also not generally acquired in feature learning parencite:Chin_Parker_2002_correlations.
 

**** exceptions that do not matter :ignhead:
There are only two noteworthy cases where correlations have an impact. 
# 
The first concerns forced-choice comparisons in which one of two objects which only differ in that one has correlated features (e.g. "small" and "sings" in the first, "small" and "eats bugs" in the second). 
# 
In such situations, correlations seem to have a effect as the object with correlated features is in 61% of the cases chosen as the more typical parencite:Malt_1984_correlated. 
#
However, Murphy judges the general applicability as limited as the absence of other distinguishing features artificially increases the salience of the correlation, while in the presence of other features the correlation has no substantial impact. 
# 
The second exception concerns logical concepts such as legal rules or tax codes, where (after substantial learning time) participants can learn necessary and sufficient feature combinations to classify concepts the membership of which would not be predictable by a the dimensions individually . 
# 
Here Murphy argues that such clear-cut concepts with logical "exclusive-or" (XOR) feature relations are not representative of natural concepts (to me, they seem reminiscent of the classical view). 
# 
For natural concepts however, Murphy rejects feature correlation as concept components since "instead of storing the facts that wings go with feathers, and feathers go with nests, and nests go with beaks, and wings go with beaks, and wings go with nests, and feathers go with beaks, and so on, we can store the facts that wings, feathers, nests, and beaks are all properties of birds, which implicitly represents the
feature-to-feature correlations" [[parencite:Murphy_2004_concepts][p.124]].
 
**** feature combinations still bad :ignhead:
# 
While there is not only little support for feature combinations,  it is also worthwhile to note that textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts propose a particular kind of feature combinations, namely those that involve all the features of a concept, and not for example combinations of pairs or triplets of features. 
# 
The previous literature had focused on feature combinations /in addition/ to features, yet the properties of the probability distribution in metric space require the disappearance of the individual features and their subsumption into exhaustive combinations. 
#
This seems to me not just one, but rather a lot of steps further from the most daring findings regarding feature combinations that the previous literature has proposed. 
# 
The motivation for this leap becomes clear when one considers the mathematical implications of these combinations: 
# 
They are mutually exclusive and can therefore be used to construct a probability distribution.
# 
For example, if one imagines a cube with each dimension split to create a total of 8 cubes that make up the larger cube, all possible 'slices' that fixes two dimensions to one value and allow the whole range of the remaining overlap in many parts which means that their positions are not independent. 
# 
As such, only cells which are exclusive combinations of /all features/ (the individual cells) can be used a  in a space of /all/ features. 
# 
This seems to indicate to me that the preferences in operationalization have taken priority over theory building: 
# 
In particular, the aim to construct a model of concepts which is both geometric and probabilistic seems to have taken preference over plausibility.


*** The cost of space
**** expensive :ignhead:
#
Another reason why probability densities within a metric space are undesirable is their complexity: 
# 
The feature space of a concept with 5 binary features requires 2^5=32 feature-cells which have to be known to grasp the meaning of the concepts.
# 
Things get worse as complexity increases exponentially: 
# 
If the 5 components are dimensions (which according to textcite:Smith_1981_categories require at least three possible values to allow for continuity and betweenness (p.120)), 3^5 = 243 combinations have to be known. 
# 
If a concept has ten binary features, 2^10 = 1024 possible combinations emerge, which explode to (at least) 3^10 = 59049 in case the components are dimensions. 
# 
The cognitive powers of the brain are of course hard to quantify. 
# 
Nevertheless, the speed with which the number of cells increases does not exactly provide strong evidence either, in particular in comparison to the feature matching perspective. 


# However, besides the increase in complexity, I cannot see a particular reason why feature combinations should matter in the first place. 
# # 
# For decades, the prototype and schema models have considered feature as the defining criterions.
# # 
# In the case of similarity assessment, feature matching seems much more plausible than the matching of feature /combinations/. 
# # 
# 
# Coming from the prototype view of textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts does take this approach. 
# # 
# While he dismisses it as due to lack of psychological evidence of features being perceived in /combination/ as well as cognitive requirements, it would seem to me as the theoretically more plausible approach as combinations of few features are less cognitively demanding (Murphy does not wander into the discussion of combinations that involve all features). 
#


**** more expensive :ignhead:
# 
Another aspect that illustrates the substantive cognitive costs is concept comparison, in particular when the feature dimensions differ (even if concepts are defined over the exact same space, the costs are still much higher than in the feature matching model as each cell - not each dimension - has to be compared). 
# 
# Probability densities can of course be compared, and as textcite:Smith_1981_categories have argued, this is likely what happens when 
# 
From a feature matching perspective, this poses no substantial problem: 
# 
The union of features and each concepts distinctive feature set can be used to make inferences about similarity judgments parencite:Tversky_1977_similarity. 
# 
In the spatial model however, the requirement of feature /combinations/ results in these concepts being defined over completely different spaces and hence not immediately comparable. 
# 
In the case of hierarchical relations (where concepts are very likely to differ in features) the authors find a solution to this issue by expanding the (smaller) concept space of the superordinate concepts to the dimensionality of the subordinate using uninformative priors (p.73), a process in which uniform values are assigned to the new cells to not 'point' the superordinate in a specific direction. 
# 
textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts illustrate this in the concept of "swimmer", a subconcept of "athlete" (p. 72). 
# 
"Athlete" as general superordinate is only characterized by "practices sport daily" (with a value of 0.8 for 1, and 0.2 for 0), whereas the more precise subordinate "swimmer" also has the dimension "trains in aquatic center". 
#
Since the athlete does not have the dimension "trains in aquatic center", his space gets expanded by making it equally likely that he trains in an aquatic center or doesn't. 
# 
This results in a probability distribution of 0.4 for training daily and training in aquatic center, 0.4 for training daily and not in aquatic center, 0.1 for not training daily but in aquatic center, and 0.1 for not training daily and not in aquatic center. 
# 
While there can be no doubt of the ingenuity of this solution, the question arises if it is theoretically plausible (even with simple concepts, hundreds of cells have to be created and assigned uninformative values by 'shifting' the probability mass around) or rather an ad-hoc adjustment that allows to maintain a geometric model. 


**** use metric stuff when needed :ignhead:
Despite their probabilistic intentions, the authors readily adapt non-probabilistic metrics when relying on combination would produce counterintuitive results. 
# 
In the case of typicality judgments, which are conceptualized as point distances between a position and the concept core (p.45).
# 
It becomes clear why probabilistic measures of feature combinations are not useful when we evaluate the similarity between the artificial string concepts "ABCDE" vs "ABCDF". 
# 
These look fairly similar, which is what one would expect from a feature matching perspective as most of the features overlap. 
# 
However, the /combination/ of all features does not overlap at all which, if concepts were perceived this way, should lead us to believe that these concepts are as dissimilar as possible. 
# 
Only by relying on traditional symmetric metrics such as cosine similarity (p.50) with all the problems they entail parencite:Tversky_1977_similarity is it possible to continuously use a geometric model. 

** Conclusion
# 
In this essay I have summarized a number of accounts on the structure of everyday concepts. 
# 
I have argued that both prototype and schema approaches are decent models that with the general notion of feature matching are adequate to capture a wide range of phenomena such as concept meaning, hierarchical relations and similarity judgments. 
#
These models have also the flexibility that one expects from concepts in every day usage, and do not suffer from rigid metric requirements. 
# 
Attempts to model concepts geometrically seem to me deficient in crucial aspects, as nonprobabilistic ones assume symmetry and triangle inequality, and probabilistic ones assume the use of feature combinations and enormous cognitive capacities without providing additional insights. 
# 
This is obviously not to say that prototypes or schemas are the last word on the matter of concepts, which everyday are deployed in so many different functions that hardly any model can be expected to account for everything. 
# 
Nor are even the basic functions sufficiently explored yet: 
# 
What in particular needs further elaboration is a theoretical account of the asymmetry that arises from comparing probability distributions, which is particularly relevant when all items are measured on the same dimensions as asymmetry does then not result from variation in features sets. 
# 
However, when it comes to the basic structure, prototypes and schemas do seem to have an edge over metric representations, probabilistic or not.

*** conceptual hierarchy

# NOPE
Second, concepts at different levels of abstraction are seen as forming a logically ordered and explicitly stored hierarchy. 
# 
If a concept is a sub-concept of another concept, all members of the sub-concept are also members of the super ordinate concept, resulting in membership being transitive (ibid., p.27)
# 
For example, if one considers dogs as a sub-concept of mammals, than every member that is a member of the set of dogs is also a member of the set of mammals [[parencite:Smith_1981_categories][p.177]]. 


# """feature storage at relevant level"""
# is that part of classical view? 
# unclear: has logic fetishism: explicitly stored links rather than similarity judgments
# but Quillian/Collins consider substantial limitations in 1969 and Quillian doesn't require logical hierarchy in any of his other papers afaik

# is it even needed? definitely don't have different features at different levels as that what defines concepts
# -> would leaving it out not require me to elaborate on features v dimensions? 
# no would still need features v dimensions because i need overlap (not distance) to drive similarity judgment


~Third??~, the features that define each level of the conceptual hierarchy are seen as stored at the level for which they are relevant to define. 
# 
While 'barking' is a feature that is relevant to define a dog, more general features that dogs share with other mammals (for example, lactation), are stored only at the more general mammal concept and can be retrieved by traversing up the explicitly stored hierarchical link between the concept of dog and mammal. 
# 
This distributed storage is argued to be more efficient parencite:Collins_1969_retrieval, as it greatly reduces the need to define all properties especially at more specific lower levels, which instead receive most defining properties from superordinate concepts. 


# A further assumption is that features are only saved at the corresponding level of abstraction: 
# 
# For example in the case of vehicles, the property of being a mechanical device to transport things is seen as associated with the most general ~vehicle~ level, the feature of having wheels and driving on roads to the intermediate and the feature of having an open cargo area associated with the most specific level. 
#
# Within such a (crisp) hierarchy, features are inherited from higher levels. 
# 
# Membership ~in the sub-concepts~ is furthermore transitive: all pick up trucks are cars as well as vehicles. 


*** location of concepts
# """debates the location of concepts, not clear if needed"""
# underlying motivation is to integrate lizardo 2016, and don't treat concepts as free floating, or arbitrary switch locations

It is certainly relevant to consider whether concepts reside in a public domain, an individual's mind, or both parencite:Lizardo_2016_improving. 
# 

- cite:Martin_2010_ant 
  - emphasizes the cognitive limitations, and therefore similarly argues to conceptualize culture as a network of concepts
  - stresses interaction with environment for sensemaking: availability heuristic, representativeness heuristic, anchoring-and-adjustment
  - *ecologically rational*: good decision making if high quality information is accessible

- [[textcite:Steyvers_2005_structure][p.44]] argue that same developmental mechanisms shape semantic association networks, whether they are personal (language acquisition)  or public (language evolution). 
- cite:Strauss_1997_cognitive: the meaning we will give to "meaning" here is the interpretation evoked /in a person/ by an object or event at a given time" (emphasis added). (p.6)

# hmm no sin-gle person knows all the entire classification system -> public? 
# is tagging system an institution? kinda.. has a place, material reality, interface
idea of explicit hierarchies seems like an imposition of public culture/order (bureaucracy) into minds

***** network structure???

# """arguing that network is good model: features as nodes, tie strength as probability densities"""

# directed? 

What might a proper structure of concepts then look like? 
# 
textcite:Steyvers_2005_structure argue that a networks provide a number of advantages over alternative models of conceptual structure. 
# not clear how to elaborate without much technical details 


Concepts can be modeled as probability distribution over features. 
#  
If a feature is typical for a concept, it would have a strong connection with this feature, whereas ties would be weaker or nonexistant for peripheral and irrelevant features, respectively. 
# 
However, in practice no qualitative distinction can be made whether something constitutes a concept, an item, or a feature. 
# 
Furthermore, concepts are often defined recursively by other concepts. 
# 

 
***** metric space ???????????
# """concepts in metric space, blurry region -> probability density"""

# it just sounds a bit more intuitive
# does it? features are binary, using metric dimension is not that catchy
# using features (of fruit, of dog is quite intuitive)

If one conceptualizes features as dimensions in a geometric space, a concept can then be spatially located. [fn::Nevertheless, the idea of feature values as geometric spaces has limitations, I will elaborate below]
problem with network is that it makes concept node

A concept does then however not constitute a point or a clear-cut area (which would be the classical view of concept defined by precise feature values), but rather a blurry region without clear-cut borders. 
#
To characterize this region, textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts invoke the notion of "probability densities" which describe the probability of each point to be a member of the concept. 



The relations between concepts can hence be inferred by the relations of their respective probability densities. 


**** other contraditctions 
- how concepts are used in every day life rather than in scientific debate (p.26) VS 
  use of explicitly stored concepts links (p. 54) and transitivity of membership (p.56)



* scrap :noexport:

Moreover, when asking participants to list features of a category (a common technique in the psychology of concepts) 

participants often list features that do not apply to every member: For example, while not all birds are capable of flight, we nevertheless consider the ability to fly a typical feature of birds. 

**** metric spaces bad
# """general idea about network structure"""

One might also ask generally in how far metric spaces are a adequate model for representing the relations between concepts. 
# 
dimensions expensive 

textcite:Steyvers_2005_structure argue that natural association patterns of words exhibit small world structure and power-law degree distributions, which are better represented by a network than by inheritance hierarchies parencite:Quillian_1988_memory or high dimensional vector spaces such as those produced by LSA. 
# 
textcite:Martin_2010_ant ~argues that the mental capacities of the human brain are severly limited.~
# 
It also seems to me that high dimensional vector spaces are cognitively expensive. 
# 
Working with high dimensional data for this project, which encompasses millions of songs, hundreds of thousands of users, and tens of thousands of genres, I also realized that the traditional ~cultural matrix~ (poetics source) model is very expensive and highly ineffective in storing such high-dimensional data. 
# 
While of course no single human brain has to deal with such a number of particular objects, the complexity arises by having to deal with a much higher amount of domains. 

~source that only relevant information is given when asked~

A network model of semantic space thus seems to provide a much more
- realistic (need quote for that)
model as it also provides a model of cognitive economy. 

~OVERLAP~
~triangle inequality~


**** metric spaces reifications
# """reflect upon how classical view is reification of bureaucracy"""
It seems to me that the view of concepts as definitions and of conceptual structure as a logically-ordered hierarchy is a reifications of bureaucratic social organization. 
#
As such ideal-typically rational administration has become wide-spread in modern societies, seems likely that it served as the template by which concepts generally were seen to be structured. 



**** Hannan informativeness 2 elaboration
# """dimensions of P2 have to be non-zero in P1 example"""

As such KDV is suited for measuring the informativeness of a sub-concept in relation to its root, as the criterion ob absolute continuity holds if a sub-concept occupies a sub-region of a conceptual space. 
# 
For example, the divergence of the concept of a ~swimmer~ from its root concept ~athlete~ can be meaningfully calculated in this fashion. 
#
Here, a swimmer has non-zero values on all attributes of the ~athlete~ category. 
# 
This is not the case for assessing the similarity between ~swimmer~ and ~weightlifter~, as the probability distributions in the dimensions that define each category (training (primarily) in pool, training (primarily) with weights) are non-overlapping. 

**** Hannan KDV fails for distinctiveness: ~NOPE~: can expand whatever the fuck you want
# """KDV not defined for comparing cohort, cos_sim is symmetric and don't account for probability density"""


It is unclear if  textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts are aware of this limitation. 
# 
When measuring the distance between concepts on the same level in the case of a cohort, they claim to "also use the Kullbach-Leibler divergence to express the degree to which a concept stands out from its cohort" (p.81). 
#
However, when they do so in practice, they use cosine similarities converted into distances using an exponential function (and then average them for each concept as a measure of its distinctiveness vis-a-vis its cohort comembers). 
# 
However, using cosine similarities of (the centers of) the feature space dimensions does not take information of the probability distribution into account. 
# 
It would for example imply that two concepts are equally similar if their centers are at the same distance, regardless of the extent to which their probability distributions overlap (figure [[fig1]]), which strikes me as unintuitive. 

It is also a symmetric distance. 
# 
One might argue that in the case of cohorts, which are situated on the same level of abstraction, it is justifiable to assume equally sized probability distributions. 

Yet the very notion of variation in typicality (e.g. the fruit example textcite:Rosch_1975_family discusses) counteracts ~this~ idea, and  will likely result in asymmetric similarity judgments as discussed by textcite:Tversky_1977_similarity in terms of China and North Korea. 
# 
Overall, using different measurements for ~these~ two cases, typicality of ~sub-conceptuality~ and distance between concepts, does not strike me as a bad idea. 
#
The question "how similar are swimmers to athletes" seems to me to be a qualitatively different one than the question "how similar are swimmers to sociologists" and therefore warranting a separate methodological approach. 



*** origin, change of classification systems
# """necessary to investiagate classification system itself"""

# 
Yet it is equally important to take a step back and investigate the processes and dynamics that in turn shape  classification systems. 
# 
A symbolic order cannot simply be treated as stable, for granted, or inevitable:
# 
As it as much relies on social processes as the action and sensemaking it enables and constrains, one  has to trace its development, institutionalization and/or abandonment based on general processes and mechanism as well as particular contingencies.

*** combine different schools
#
Given the importance of classification systems, hardly any subdiscipline (~or even discipline~) has been able to mark it as an exclusively field of study. 
# 
I therefore combine insights from neoinstitutionalism, organizational sociology and the psychology of concepts to 
# 
Each of these areas contributes complementary insights. 
- Neoinstitutionalism: 
  - practical action? 
  - legitimacy? 
  - audience? 
- organizational sociology
  - ecology/community/

- psychology of concept 
  - 
The contribution of the latter one can maybe be defined most clearly due to
- their dogmatism, normal science (Kuhn)
- sharp boundaries: only focus on concepts internal or in relation to others, not much wider array of social influences
- exclusive focus 
- bracketing out of social questions
Such paradigm, while obviously limited to investigate social impact, has nevertheless provided elaborate ~meat and bones~ models on 
- concept structure, 
- information processing, 
- similarity judgments
- typicality ratings
- feature ~something~


Meanwhile, the much less clearly defined neoinstitutionalism and organizational school provide the correspondingly more diverse social influences. 
# 
audience
# that's literally the only thing for now



*** useless tversky stuff
textcite:McPherson_1983_affiliation describes the same phenomenon is described in an ecological study of the relations between organizational forms based on their niches in socio-demographic space. 
# 
While he focuses on competition rather than similarity, he employs a approach based on (socio-demographic feature) overlap as he argues for asymmetric competition coefficients (p.526) based on "the ratio of the volume of overlap between two types of organizations and the volume of the niche base for the type under examination" (p. 528).
# 
Another implication of using distance between centers would be that the extent of the probability density would not effect similarity judgments. 
# 
~the same distances can result in different overlaps, which seems likely to lead to different similarity judgments.~

*** caveat classical view
# """argues that classical gets bad rep by ignoring caveats/overgeneralizing clear hierarchies to universal conceptual structure"""

# would need to read Smith/Medin 1981? 
# ok done now
# classical view is not really about multiple levels, more about how single concept is built up
# doesn't mention transitivity violations
# but reaction times/similarity judgement in nested triples
# feature overlap is liked more


One might argue that what textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts and cite:Hannan_2019_concepts present as the classical view is not as clearly defined as it is made to appear. 
#
For example, the research of textcite:Collins_1969_retrieval is often referred to as proposing a transitive hierarchical structure of concepts parencite:Sloman_1998_tree,Steyvers_2005_structure,Murphy_2004_concepts,Hannan_2019_concepts. 
# 
However, textcite:Collins_1969_retrieval explicitly warn against taking the hierarchical structure with inherited properties as a general model of conceptual structure: 

#+begin_quote
A caution is in order here: Dictionary definitions are not very orderly and we doubt that human memory, which is far richer, is even as orderly as a dictionary. One difficulty is that hierarchies are not always clearly ordered, exemplified by dog, mammal and animal. Subjects tend to categorize a dog as an animal, even though a stricter classification would impose the category mammal between the two. (p.242)
#+end_quote

# 
In other words, the fact that some classification systems are characterized by a strict hierarchical structure does not merit generalization to all conceptual structures. 
# 
textcite:Quillian_1966_memory also shows that he is clearly aware of the limitations of hierarchical and has adopted his model accordingly: 

#+begin_quote
Programs by Green (1961), and by Lindsay (1961), explored the idea of using a memory organized as a single predefined hierarchy. [...] However, this kind of organization becomes uncomfortably rigid as larger amounts of material are considered, and is clearly not a general enough organization for the diverse knowledge people know and utilize. (p.6)
#+end_quote


# In a later version of the same research parencite:Quillian_1988_memory, he notes: 
# #+begin_quote
# [A dictionary-like] outline organization is only adequate for one hierarchical grouping, when in fact the common elements existing between various meanings of a word call for a complex cross classification. In other words, the common elements within and between various meanings of a word are many, and any one outline designed to get some of these together under common headings must at the same time necessarily separate other common elements, equally valid from some other point of view. Making the present memory network a /general graph rather than a tree/ (the network equivalent of an outline) [...] makes it possible to [...] show any and every common element within and between the meanings of a word. (p.88, emphasis added)
# #+end_quote

# On the surface the caveat might only be seen to the meaning of features. 
# # 
# However, given the interchangeability between concepts and features parencite:Smith_1981_categories, it seems to have implications for relations between concepts as well: 
# # 
# Just as features may be common to multiple concepts, 

*** measurement?
**** Hannan hierarchy relations
# """KVD only works for informativeness"""

textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts use the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KDV) to measure distance between concepts (p.75), which is calculated as 
#
\begin{equation*}
D_{KL}(P_1||P_2) = \sum\limits_{x \in \mathbb{G}} P_1(x)  \log \left( \frac{P_1(x)}{P_2(x)} \right)
\end{equation*}
#
They however do not mention that KDV is only defined under absolute continuity, which requires that for all x where P_2(x) is zero, P_1(x) likewise has to be zero (~better source than wikipedia~). 
# 
Failure of this restriction would result the fraction to be undefined. 
# 
The opposite case, (P_1 being zero at an x where P_2 is non-zero) does pose less of a problem: 
# 
While log(0) is negative infinite, the entire expression becomes 0 as the following applies: 

\begin{equation*}
\lim \limits_{x \rightarrow 0^{+}} x \log(x) = 0
\end{equation*}


** conceptual ecology
# """postulates based on ecological framework"""

# 
The original formulation of textcite:hannan89_organ,Hannan_1992_dynamics rests on an in interpretation of density dependence that emphasizes the role of legitimation and competition. 
# 

industries with little data available besides count -> different roots describe different industries (somewhat independent)


If cohort size is a measure of density, one would expect a cohort nonmonontic relation between cohort size and survival chances: 
# 
At first, an established, but rarely imitated genre provides much potential for legitimating sub-genres. 
# 
However, the more sub-genres are formed, the higher the competition for the region of the musical space spanned by the superordinate genre. 




* questions (list of ideas with more or less relevance) :noexport:
can i test prototype vs exemplar model? 
do they imply different mechanisms for survival? 

Piazzai doesn't even use word
- exemplar/prototype view
- *atypicality*
  Hannan: equivalent to informativeness

  idc much about that relation

  
reflection (Lizardo)
if i make for each genre a "spread-score": how big the tension between genres is (low for heavy metal and black metal, higher for black metal and opera) -> can average that to the genre level


~is quillian part of the classical model?~ -> look up the source that Murphy cites, duh


*inclusion fallacy* against explicitly stored hierarchies (used by Murphy):  
- robin have X -> all birds have X more believable than robins have X -> ostriches have X
- can't see how that supports computed
- is typicality effect, but typicality can be considered in hierarchy
- maybe murphy didn't consider Hannan's view yet (argues against "logical reasoning")

Murphy sees typicality effects (birds have X -> robins/ostriches have X stronger for robins) as "greatest problem for pre-stored view"

"Findings of typicality effects, intransitivity of class inclusion, and evidence from RT experiments all pose problems for the stored hierarchy view" (p.209)
