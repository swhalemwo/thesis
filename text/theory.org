** notes alex
DV: survival or abandonment of cognitive labels used by audiences. 

Mechanisms: 
- Conceptual informativeness or distinctiveness. -> using the musicological features of songs.  
- Distinctiveness: Piazzai approach. MDS of features. Songs. Spherical space. 
- Informativeness: hierarchical concept. nature of the relations among concepts. 
- Audience niche size. 
- Audience composition: avant-garde or mainstream. 
- Status: average Billboard. Label could be more widely applied in aesthetic and social space. Expansion of use of genre labels due to increased popularity.
- Density measures. 
- Legitimation= same as status. 
- Rapid adoption could lead to abandonment. 

Methodological:
- assymmetry: 
- identification of genre-labels
- nature of the relations among concepts. 
- how tightly connceted the audiences are? two-mode not well connected individual listeners. 
- length of the time period. 
- Billboard. 


** own notes
unit of analysis is concept -> start with concepts

ecological 

add stuff about partiality 
- mean
  - high: salient
  - low: peripheral
- skew:
  - high: concentration
  - low: equality

can there be low mean but high skew? 

theoretical implications: 

*** fuzziness
concept (fruit) is fuzzy if there are objects (olive) of which it is not clear whether it belongs or not

classical category: just 100s (rest 0s)
somewhat fuzzy: many 100s, some non 100s

very fuzzy: many non 100s

the lower the average weight, the fuzzier the category? 

electronic: will be more fuzzy than syncwave-electrofunk
but that's accurate isn't it? 
people who use a very specific label know it well, have clearer criteria -> can make membership more binary

*** informativeness
needs hierarchy!!!

average informativeness?

need way to formalize informativeness from asymmetric competition coefs

hierarchy is a way to deal with asymmetry
Tversky thinks so too: [[cite:Smith_1981_categories][p.118]]

make the use more the improvisations (Bourdieu) -> stresses flexibility

*** other areas of concepts: 
- psychology
- neurophysiology
- information science

*** how to frame contribution
- more complete view of concepts
- different mechanisms (conceptual, audience, status)

** introduction
*** meaning important for social order/action :ignhead:
# """classification systems (sensemaking) are crucial for social order, action"""

# namedrop meaning, interpretation, framing

Classification systems are essential for social life parencite:Durkheim_2019_primitive. 
# 
Without conceptual systems to aid in our sense-making, no order could be imposed on a chaotic world ~Kant?~. 
# 
The ways in which the world is symbolic divided up can facilitate understanding and coordination if agreement over them is obtained, be it through cooperation or imposition parencite:diMaggio_1983_iron. 
# 
Visions of division can compete [[parencite:Bourdieu_1989_space][p.17]], yet competition can also occur in the case of shared classification systems where agreement exists over what is at stake [[parencite:Fligstein_2015_fields][p.27]].

The importance of categories for social action can hardly be understated.

*** origin, change of classification systems
# """necessary to investiagate classification system itself"""

# 
Yet it is equally important to take a step back and investigate the processes and dynamics that in turn shape  classification systems. 
# 
A symbolic order cannot simply be treated as stable, for granted, or inevitable:
# 
As it as much relies on social processes as the action and sensemaking it enables and constrains, one  has to trace its development, institutionalization and/or abandonment based on general processes and mechanism as well as particular contingencies.

*** combine different schools
#
Given the importance of classification systems, hardly any subdiscipline (~or even discipline~) has been able to mark it as an exclusively field of study. 
# 
I therefore combine insights from neoinstitutionalism, organizational sociology and the psychology of concepts to 
# 
Each of these areas contributes complementary insights. 
- Neoinstitutionalism: 
  - practical action? 
  - legitimacy? 
  - audience? 
- organizational sociology
  - ecology/community/

- psychology of concept 
  - 
The contribution of the latter one can maybe be defined most clearly due to
- their dogmatism, normal science (Kuhn)
- sharp boundaries: only focus on concepts internal or in relation to others, not much wider array of social influences
- exclusive focus 
- bracketing out of social questions
Such paradigm, while obviously limited to investigate social impact, has nevertheless provided elaborate ~meat and bones~ models on 
- concept structure, 
- information processing, 
- similarity judgments
- typicality ratings
- feature ~something~


Meanwhile, the much less clearly defined neoinstitutionalism and organizational school provide the correspondingly more diverse social influences. 
# 
audience
# that's literally the only thing for now


** concepts
#

*** location of concepts
# """debates the location of concepts, not clear if needed"""
# underlying motivation is to integrate lizardo 2016, and don't treat concepts as free floating, or arbitrary switch locations

It is certainly relevant to consider whether concepts reside in a public domain, an individual's mind, or both parencite:Lizardo_2016_improving. 
# 

- cite:Martin_2010_ant emphasizes the cognitive limitations, and therefore similarly argues to conceptualize culture as a network of concepts
  stresses interaction with environment for sensemaking: availability heuristic, representativeness heuristic, anchoring-and-adjustment
  *ecologically rational*: good decision making if high quality information is accessible

- [[textcite:Steyvers_2005_structure][p.44]] argue that same developmental mechanisms shape semantic association networks, whether they are personal, (language acquisition)  or public (language evolution). 
- cite:Strauss_1997_cognitive: the meaning we will give to "meaning" here is the interpretation evoked /in a person/ by an object or event at a given time" (emphasis added). (p.6)

# hmm no sin-gle person knows all the entire classification system -> public? 
# is tagging system an institution? kinda.. has a place, material reality, interface
idea of explicit hierarchies seems like an imposition of public culture/order (bureaucracy) into minds

 


# 

*** classical view
# """introduces classical view: definitions, hierarchy, feature storage at relevant level"""

# is bluerprint actually a good metaphor? quite technical/precise/exact, qute unlike fuzzy probability distributions
# alternatives: template, matrix (too technical), schema/scheme? 
# feature is that it is used to produce things; is abstraction

Given
- logocentrism (Derrida)
- bureaucratization/iron cage 
  - narrow down to institutional logic? 

It may seem intuitive to think that concepts adhere to a unambiguous and internally coherent structure 
# (~it certainly seems to an extent be the prevailing worldview in formal education systems~) . 
# 
This general idea of well-orderedness is what textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts calls the "classical view", and argues that it not only constitutes a lay understanding of concepts, but was the established paradigm in the psychology of concepts until the 1970s. 
# 
The classical view makes a number of assumptions. 
# 
First, it argues that concepts are definitions which can be clearly defined with a list of necessary and/or jointly sufficient features. 
# 
Inspired by set theory, a necessary consequence of this assumption is to view category membership as clear cut (objects are either complete members of categories, or they are not members at all) and view each object that fulfills these exact criteria as an equal member (p.15).  
# 
Second, concepts at different levels of abstraction are seen as forming a logically ordered and explicitly stored hierarchy. 
# 
If a concept is a sub-concept of another concept, all members of the sub-concept are also members of the super ordinate concept, resulting in membership being transitive. 
# 
For example, if one considers dogs as a sub-concept of mammals, than every member that is a member of the set of dogs is also a member of the set of mammals. 
# 
~Third??~, the features that define each level of the conceptual hierarchy are seen as stored at the level for which they are relevant to define. 
# 
While 'barking' is a feature that is relevant to define a dog, more general features that dogs share with other mammals (for example, lactation), are stored only at the more general mammal concept and can be retrieved by traversing up the explicitly stored hierarchical link between the concept of dog and mammal. 
# 
This distributed storage is argued to be more efficient, as it greatly reduces the need to define all properties especially at more specific lower levels, which instead receive most defining properties from superordinate concepts. 


# A further assumption is that features are only saved at the corresponding level of abstraction: 
# 
# For example in the case of vehicles, the property of being a mechanical device to transport things is seen as associated with the most general ~vehicle~ level, the feature of having wheels and driving on roads to the intermediate and the feature of having an open cargo area associated with the most specific level. 
#
# Within such a (crisp) hierarchy, features are inherited from higher levels. 
# 
# Membership ~in the sub-concepts~ is furthermore transitive: all pick up trucks are cars as well as vehicles. 

*** new view
cite:Murphy_2004_concepts argues that each of these points has received criticisms to an extent that they have been abandoned or heavily reformulated. 
# 
I will start with the notion of concepts as definitions. 

**** probabilistic 
# """Wittgenstein quote: no clear definitions possible"""
textcite:Wittgenstein_1968_investigations argues that while we have an understanding of what a game entails, there is no precise definition of them: 

#+begin_quote
If you look at [board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on] you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities and relationships [...] Look for example at board-games, with their multifarious relationships. Now pass to card-games; here you find many correspondences with the first group, but many common features drop out, and others appear. When we pass next to ball-games, much that is common is retained, but much is lost. Are they all 'amusing'? Compare chess with noughts and crosses. Or is there always winning and losing, or competition between players? Think of patience. In ball games there is winning and losing; but when a child throws his ball at the wall and catches it again, this feature has disappeared. Look at the parts played by skill and luck; and at the difference between skill in chess and skill in tennis. Think now of games like ring-a-ring-a-roses; here is the element of amusement, but how many other characteristic features have disappeared! And we can go through the many, many other groups of games in the same way; can see how similarities crop up and disappear. And the result of this examination is: we see a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail. (p.31)
#+end_quote

Following Wittgenstein's argument in regard to inability to clearly define a game in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts,Hannan_2019_concepts argue that concepts are fuzzy and entail blurred boundaries. [fn::It might be noteworthy to point out that such impossibility to clearly define a concept is not confined to the realms that attempt to make sense of social action. As these blurry boundaries are a feature of classification systems generally, they also occur in technical domains such as the planethood of Pluto, or the classification of polyhedras parencite:Lakatos_2015_proofs.]
 
**** probabilistic 2 WORK WORK
# """typicality, graded membership, MODEL??"""
# 
The abandonment of crisp boundaries does not entail the adoption of an arbitrary 'postmodern' 'anything-goes' approach, or more precisely a caricature thereof. 
# 
Rather, the proper reformulation of crisp boundaries is through a probabilistic notion of features co-occurence. 
# 
A clear implication of a probabilistic formulation is variation in typicality instead of clear-cut membership, which textcite:Rosch_1975_family show in the case of fruits. 
# 
While apples and oranges are very typical members of the category fruit, blueberries and lemons are rated as less typical, while tomatoes and olives are given the lowest typicality ratings. 

# expand on FEATURES leading to high typicality judgement
# could use Smith/Medin (all items similar to ~fruit~ category) -> lead into network as model: this raises the so-far overlooked question how concept storage is structured

# network structure here? 
# network as general structure, metric space as exception that still fulfills all conditions? 
# fits better with idea of feature overlap

***** network structure???
# """arguing that network is good model: features as nodes, tie strength as probability densities"""

# directed? 

What might a proper structure of concepts then look like? 
# 
textcite:Steyvers_2005_structure argue that a networks provide a number of advantages over alternative models of conceptual structure. 
# not clear how to elaborate without much technical details 


Concepts can be modeled as probability distribution over features. 
#  
If a feature is typical for a concept, it would have a strong connection with this feature, whereas ties would be weaker or nonexistant for peripheral and irrelevant features, respectively. 
# 
However, in practice no qualitative distinction can be made whether something constitutes a concept, an item, or a feature. 
# 
Furthermore, concepts are often defined recursively by other concepts. 
# 

 
***** metric space ???????????
# """concepts in metric space, blurry region -> probability density"""

# it just sounds a bit more intuitive
# does it? features are binary, using metric dimension is not that catchy
# using features (of fruit, of dog is quite intuitive)

If one conceptualizes features as dimensions in a geometric space, a concept can then be spatially located. [fn::Nevertheless, the idea of feature values as geometric spaces has limitations, I will elaborate below]
problem with network is that it makes concept node

A concept does then however not constitute a point or a clear-cut area (which would be the classical view of concept defined by precise feature values), but rather a blurry region without clear-cut borders. 
#
To characterize this region, textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts invoke the notion of "probability densities" which describe the probability of each point to be a member of the concept. 



The relations between concepts can hence be inferred by the relations of their respective probability densities. 


**** asymmetric distances
# """ argues that asymmetric distances can be explained by feature overlap"""
#
The conceptualization of concepts as probability densities has further implications for the relationship between concepts. 
# 
One concerns similarity judgments. 
# 
Since the feature space can be a conventional geometric space, it seems straightforward to measure distances (or dissimilarities) between concept in some form as a Euclidean distance - such as between the centers or the borders. 
# 
This would then result in a symmetric distance, as the distance from concept A to concept B would be the same as from concept B to concept A. 
# 
However, textcite:Tversky_1977_similarity finds that similarity judgments can differ depending on the order in which two items are to be compared. 
# 
Specifically, he finds that North Korea is judged to be more similar to China than China is judged to be similar to North Korea (Figure [[fig1]], left). 
# 
Rather than Euclidean distance, these similarities judgments are based on feature overlap of the probability densities cite:Murphy_2004_concepts. 
#
While the overlap is the same for each concept, its proportion of the entire probability distribution can vary if the size of the probability distributions of the concepts differ. 
# 
textcite:McPherson_1983_affiliation describes the same phenomenon is described in an ecological study of the relations between organizational forms based on their niches in socio-demographic space. 
# 
While he focuses on competition rather than similarity, he employs a approach based on (socio-demographic feature) overlap as he argues for asymmetric competition coefficients (p.526) based on "the ratio of the volume of overlap between two types of organizations and the volume of the niche base for the type under examination" (p. 528).
# 
Another implication of using distance between centers would be that the extent of the probability density would not effect similarity judgments. 
# 
However, in figure [[fig1]] (middle and right), the same distances can result in different overlaps, which seems likely to lead to different similarity judgments. 

#+caption: properties of concepts as probability densities
#+label: fig1
[[file:fig1.png]]


**** triangle inequality violations
# """ argues that metric feature overlap can capture triangle inequality"""
# 
Similarity values based on feature overlap can also explain another finding that poses question for the view of concepts residing in a conventional geometric space, namely triangle inequality violations. 
# 
For any triangle, each side must be larger or equal to the sum of the other sides. 
# 
If similarity judgments were point distances, this would imply that concept A would need to be at least as similar to concept C as the sum of the similarity of A to B and B to C. 
# 
However, textcite:Tversky_1977_similarity finds this geometrical property violated in the case of Jamaica, Cuba and Russia. 
# 
Jamaica and Cuba are judged fairly similar, and so are Cuba and Russia, but Jamaica is seen as very unsimillar to Russia, and particularly more so than would be expected based on the previous judgments. 
# 
Again, feature overlap provides a sufficient explanation: 
# 
While Jamaica and Cuba share the feature of being in located the Caribbean, and Cuba and Russia were both seen as socialist countries, neither of these two features are shared between Jamaica and Russia, resulting in a low similarity rating. 
# 
This even questions the possibility to depict concepts (in this case, countries) as probability distributions within a feature space, as Jamaica is not just not-socialist, but as its popular imagination is not characterized by its political system, it simply has no value on a political dimension. 
# 
Geometric spaces thus function as an adequate visualization of features only to the extent to which all items or concepts in question can be assumed to have values for all feature dimensions. 

# does this kill geometric spaces 
# not necessarily, but the J, C, R example does

# Feature overlap does not treat the metric space as a space itself, but as defined by underlying attributes, the overlap of which is what leads to similarity judgements. 
# 
# It is thus able to asymmetric similarity judgments (~figure Y~) as well as variation in similarity judgements given same metric distance (~figure X~). 

# ~need to clarify when it is spoken of items/objects (points) and when of concepts (densities)~
# what are the fruits? is apple an object or a subconcept? 
# according to Rosch they're items
# items (e.g. pen in front of me) always get described in terms of concepts, which are blurry



*** hierarchy

**** Hannan conceptual space
# """summarizes Hannan's hierarchical structure, contrast changes from classical view"""

# might want to change Hannan to more general classical view? 

To recapture, the classical views argues that concepts at different levels of abstraction are stored within a chain of logical subset and superset relations; textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts to a large extent follow textcite:Collins_1969_retrieval in conceptualizing concepts as stored explicitly in a hierarchical network. 
#
They conceptualize the resulting conceptual space as a semi-lattice, a nested tree built from sub-concept relations. 
# 
In this directed tree, conceptual /roots/ (e.g. vehicles) spawn /cohorts/ of concepts (e.g. car, ship, plane); groups of concepts at the same level of abstraction. 
#
They nevertheless diverge from the classical to some extent. 
# 
First, they consider feature inheritance as probabilistic, as more typical subconcepts inherit more features ~and feature dimensions~ from their roots than atypical ones. 
#
Second, they explicitly allow inheritance from multiple parents, which takes into accounts 'hybrids' such as romantic comedies. 

**** Hannan bad
# """explictly stored hierarchical links bad because of transitivity violations, response times"""

However, it seems to me that despite these additions the assumption of explicitly stored hierarchical links is not consistent with theoretical considerations and empirical evidence. 
#
Instead, I find more convincing the argument of textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts that hierarchical links are not explicitly stored, but computed based on similarity values. 
#
One reason is transitivity of membership. 
#
Murphy (refering to ~source~) argues that when subjects agree that chairs are a type of furniture, and car seats are a type of chairs, they nevertheless do not consider car seats a type of furniture. 
#
He argues that the features that car seat shares with chair are different from those that chair shares with furniture, which leads to refusal of membership even if it would follow on logical grounds. 
#
A further argument against explicitly stored hierarchical links are response times. 
#
If features are only stored at one level, inferences would take the longer the more hierarchical links they have to traverse through. 
# 
While this holds in some cases ~page~, it can also be violated: 
# 
cite:Murphy_2004_concepts and ~other source (Rips et al)~ find that verifying the statement 'a dog is an animal' is faster than the verifying the statement 'a dog is a mammal'. 
# 
If hierarchical links were explicitly stored, the latter statement would be faster as the mammal concept would be closer to the dog concept than the animal concept of which it is a subconcept of. 
# 
Murphy explains this with dogs being more typical animals than mammals. 
# wouldn't it need to be: dogs are more typical of animals than they are of mammals? 


# distance in conceptual space: smart and pickup truck are further apart (have to link through car) than each with car


**** Hannan feature duplication
# """Hannan features duplication, unconvincing: expensive, hierarchical links ineffective -> computation"""
# 
textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts are aware of the latter argument of response times, and therefore argue that features duplicated at lower levels. 
#
As this feature replication is based on typicality and therefore probabilistical it is compatible with variation in inference time based on typicality. 
#
I however do not find this satisfactory: 
# 
It breaks with the idea of cognitive economy parencite:Collins_1969_retrieval of hierarchies as an efficient storage of conceptual information. 
# 
It also renders the hierarchical links ineffective: 
# 
Since textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts argue that features are passed down (not conceptual memberships; i.e. a dog has animal and mammal features, but not the concept labels), it turns questions of membership effectively into computation: 
# 
- Since the goal of feature replication is to avoid having to travers the hierarchical pathways, 
- Rather than traversing the hierarchical paths, 
the question of whether a dog is a an animal would then be solved by comparing the features of a dog (which now includes those of mammals and animals) with that of an animal. 
#
It also appears to me to be an add-hoc addition to explain empirical observations rather than being the result of theoretical necessity. 


**** Hannan feature duplication2
# """still unconvincing: not clear why speed differs: would require addtitional categories/worldviews, but not discussed"""

But even if features are replicated at lower levels, it seems implausible that
inferences from lower to general (dog -> animal) could be /faster/ than from low to medium (dog -> mammal).
#
Two different explanations might be possible: 
#
Mammal features might not be passed on as much as animal features, which might be accurate as dogs are not typical mammals (most of interaction with and/or public imagination of dogs is unrelated to mammal characteristics).
# 
Alternatively, animal features might be passed down from a different category, for example ~pets~ (which, as they are no subcategory of mammals, do not pass down mammal features. 
#
This would require further specification on the relationship between the concepts mammals and pets. 
#
While both are sub-concepts of animals, they do not seem to be part of the same cohort: 
# 
Mammals as a term for taxonomic classification would be in a cohort with concepts such as fish and reptiles, while pets, which specifies the relation to humans, would be in the same cohort as farm animals and wild animals. 
#
As such a dog is not a hybrid in the same sense as a romantic comedy is as the concepts belong to different "visions of division" [[parencite:Bourdieu_1989_space][p.17]] where different things are at stake [[parencite:Fligstein_2015_fields][p.27]]. 
# 
These issues are not yet discussed by textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts who mentions such cases, but limit his discussion of multiple membership to hierarchically structured taxonomies (p.199), or textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts, who discuss ambiguity due to multiple membership with regards to concepts of the same cohort (p.152). 


*** caveat classical view
# """argues that classical gets bad rep by ignoring caveats/overgeneralizing clear hierarchies to universal conceptual structure"""

# would need to read Smith/Medin 1981? 
# ok done now
# classical view is not really about multiple levels, more about how single concept is built up
# doesn't mention transitivity violations
# but reaction times/similarity judgement in nested triples
# feature overlap is liked more


One might argue that what textcite:Murphy_2004_concepts and cite:Hannan_2019_concepts present as the classical view is not as clearly defined as it is made to appear. 
#
For example, the research of textcite:Collins_1969_retrieval is often referred to as proposing a transitive hierarchical structure of concepts parencite:Sloman_1998_tree,Steyvers_2005_structure,Murphy_2004_concepts,Hannan_2019_concepts. 
# 
However, textcite:Collins_1969_retrieval explicitly warn against taking the hierarchical structure with inherited properties as a general model of conceptual structure: 

#+begin_quote
A caution is in order here: Dictionary definitions are not very orderly and we doubt that human memory, which is far richer, is even as orderly as a dictionary. One difficulty is that hierarchies are not always clearly ordered, exemplified by dog, mammal and animal. Subjects tend to categorize a dog as an animal, even though a stricter classification would impose the category mammal between the two. (p.242)
#+end_quote

# 
In other words, the fact that some classification systems are characterized by a strict hierarchical structure does not merit generalization to all conceptual structures. 
# 
textcite:Quillian_1966_memory also shows that he is clearly aware of the limitations of hierarchical and has adopted his model accordingly: 

#+begin_quote
Programs by Green (1961), and by Lindsay (1961), explored the idea of using a memory organized as a single predefined hierarchy. Green's program showed that such a memory can be interrogated with natural language questions, and Lindsay's demonstrated that this kind of memory organization can provide certain inference-making properties, as long as information is confined to a single subject like a family tree. However, this kind of organization becomes uncomfortably rigid as larger amounts of material are considered, and is clearly not a general enough organization for the diverse knowledge people know and utilize. (p.6)
#+end_quote

In a later version of the same research parencite:Quillian_1988_memory, he notes: 

#+begin_quote
[A dictionary-like] outline organization is only adequate for one hierarchical grouping, when in fact the common elements existing between various meanings of a word call for a complex cross classification. In other words, the common elements within and between various meanings of a word are many, and any one outline designed to get some of these together under common headings must at the same time necessarily separate other common elements, equally valid from some other point of view. Making the present memory network a /general graph rather than a tree/ (the network equivalent of an outline) [...] makes it possible to [...] show any and every common element within and between the meanings of a word. (p.88, emphasis added)
#+end_quote



*** measurement?
**** Hannan hierarchy relations
# """KVD only works for informativeness"""


textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts use the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KDV) to measure distance between concepts (p.75), which is calculated as 
#
\begin{equation*}
D_{KL}(P_1||P_2) = \sum\limits_{x \in \mathbb{G}} P_1(x)  \log \left( \frac{P_1(x)}{P_2(x)} \right)
\end{equation*}
#
They however do not mention that KDV is only defined under absolute continuity, which requires that for all x where P_2(x) is zero, P_1(x) likewise has to be zero (~better source than wikipedia~). 
# 
Failure of this restriction would result the fraction to be undefined. 
# 
The opposite case, (P_1 being zero at an x where P_2 is non-zero) does pose less of a problem: 
# 
While log(0) is negative infinite, the entire expression becomes 0 as the following applies: 

\begin{equation*}
\lim \limits_{x \rightarrow 0^{+}} x \log(x) = 0
\end{equation*}


**** Hannan informativeness 2 elaboration
# """dimensions of P2 have to be non-zero in P1 example"""


As such KDV is suited for measuring the informativeness of a sub-concept in relation to its root, as the criterion ob absolute continuity holds if a sub-concept occupies a sub-region of a conceptual space. 
# 
For example, the divergence of the concept of a ~swimmer~ from its root concept ~athlete~ can be meaningfully calculated in this fashion. 
#
Here, a swimmer has non-zero values on all attributes of the ~athlete~ category. 
# 
This is not the case for assessing the similarity between ~swimmer~ and ~weightlifter~, as the probability distributions in the dimensions that define each category (training (primarily) in pool, training (primarily) with weights) are non-overlapping. 

**** Hannan KDV fails for distinctiveness
# """KDV not defined for comparing cohort, cos_sim is symmetric and don't account for probability density"""


It is unclear if  textcite:Hannan_2019_concepts are aware of this limitation. 
# 
When measuring the distance between concepts on the same level in the case of a cohort, they claim to "also use the Kullbach-Leibler divergence to express the degree to which a concept stands out from its cohort" (p.81). 
#
However, when they do so in practice, they use cosine similarities converted into distances using an exponential function (and then average them for each concept as a measure of its distinctiveness vis-a-vis its cohort comembers). 
# 
However, using cosine similarities of (the centers of) the feature space dimensions does not take information of the probability distribution into account. 
# 
It would for example imply that two concepts are equally similar if their centers are at the same distance, regardless of the extent to which their probability distributions overlap (figure [[fig1]]), which strikes me as unintuitive. 

It is also a symmetric distance. 
# 
One might argue that in the case of cohorts, which are situated on the same level of abstraction, it is justifiable to assume equally sized probability distributions. 

Yet the very notion of variation in typicality (e.g. the fruit example textcite:Rosch_1975_family discusses) counteracts ~this~ idea, and  will likely result in asymmetric similarity judgments as discussed by textcite:Tversky_1977_similarity in terms of China and North Korea. 
# 
Overall, using different measurements for ~these~ two cases, typicality of ~sub-conceptuality~ and distance between concepts, does not strike me as a bad idea. 
#
The question "how similar are swimmers to athletes" seems to me to be a qualitatively different one than the question "how similar are swimmers to sociologists" and therefore warranting a separate methodological approach. 



**** metric spaces bad
# """general idea about network structure"""

One might also ask generally in how far metric spaces are a adequate model for representing the relations between concepts. 
# 
dimensions expensive 

textcite:Steyvers_2005_structure argue that natural association patterns of words exhibit small world structure and power-law degree distributions, which are better represented by a network than by inheritance hierarchies parencite:Quillian_1988_memory or high dimensional vector spaces such as those produced by LSA. 
# 
textcite:Martin_2010_ant ~argues that the mental capacities of the human brain are severly limited.~
# 
It also seems to me that high dimensional vector spaces are cognitively expensive. 
# 
Working with high dimensional data for this project, which encompasses millions of songs, hundreds of thousands of users, and tens of thousands of genres, I also realized that the traditional ~cultural matrix~ (poetics source) model is very expensive and highly ineffective in storing such high-dimensional data. 
# 
While of course no single human brain has to deal with such a number of particular objects, the complexity arises by having to deal with a much higher amount of domains. 

~source that only relevant information is given when asked~

A network model of semantic space thus seems to provide a much more
- realistic (need quote for that)
model as it also provides a model of cognitive economy. 

~OVERLAP~
~triangle inequality~


**** metric spaces reifications
# """reflect upon how classical view is reification of bureaucracy"""
It seems to me that the view of concepts as definitions and of conceptual structure as a logically-ordered hierarchy is a reifications of bureaucratic social organization. 
#
As such ideal-typically rational administration has become wide-spread in modern societies, seems likely that it served as the template by which concepts generally were seen to be structured. 


** conceptual ecology
# """postulates based on ecological framework"""

# 
The original formulation of textcite:hannan89_organ,Hannan_1992_dynamics rests on an in interpretation of density dependence that emphasizes the role of legitimation and competition. 
# 

industries with little data available besides count -> different roots describe different industries (somewhat independent)


If cohort size is a measure of density, one would expect a cohort nonmonontic relation between cohort size and survival chances: 
# 
At first, an established, but rarely imitated genre provides much potential for legitimating sub-genres. 
# 
However, the more sub-genres are formed, the higher the competition for the region of the musical space spanned by the superordinate genre. 





** duality,- audience
# """audience composition matters"""

While concepts for analytical purposes can be considered as entities on their own, they do not exist only in feature or conceptual spaces. 
# 
Instead, drawing on a tradition of duality which stresses the mutual constitutiveness of for example persons and groups parencite:Breiger_1974_duality, culture and practice parencite:Mohr_1997_duality or niche and organizational form parencite:Mohr_2010_niche, I argue that genres need to be considered as "partially constituted by the audiences that support them" [[parencite:dimaggio1987classification][p.441]]. 
#
DiMaggio elaborates that "genres represent socially constructed organizing principles that imbue artworks with significance /beyond their thematic content/ and are in turn, responsive to structurally generated demand for cultural information and affiliation" (ibid., emphasis added). 
#
It is therefore crucial to not only consider the conceptual features and the relations between genres based on them, but furthermore go beyond the thematic content and focus on the social motivations for genre support. 
# actually is as much about forms of financing, not class determinism
# maybe bourdieu? 
The prime example is again by textcite:Dimaggio_1982_entrepreneur, who argues that the institutionalization of fine arts did not follow on grounds of "qualities inherent to the work of art" (p.33), but was driven by the demand of the upper middle classes to isolate and differentiate high from popular culture. 

# 

*** consumption styles (omnivorism, purism) beyond thematic content? 
# 
Next to fundamental social boundaries such as class that are clear 'beyond thematic content' of genres, what other audience characteristics might play a role in genre survival? 
# 
It seems to me that consumption styles are certainly worthy of consideration. 
#
These are 
- omnivorism cite:Lizardo_2014_holes
- taste for atypicality cite:Goldberg_2016_span
- taste for popularity cite:Lieberson_2003_popularity,Kovacs_2014_paradox 
# 
These consumption styles are in one way or another based on overall consumption pattern as well as item properties. 
#
Nevertheless, I argue that they constitute "transposable form of the aesthetic disposition" [[textcite:Lizardo_2012_reconcept][p.263, for omnivorism]] and can therefore reasonably assumed to influence genre survival chances. 

# am i doing circular argument with popularity? 
# DV will be based on playcounts
# think not: taste for popularity is reflection in similar way as atypicality thing

*** conceptualizing omnivorousness
# What mechanism of cultural information and affiliation can we expect to be present in early 21st century music consumption? 
# 
# Certainly boundaries over genres in the informal, ~detached/autonomous~ realm of last.fm are not limited to the (~reified~) distinctions of highbrow and lowbrow. 
# 
The notion of omnivorism has been an influential concept in the research on cultural consumption. 
# 
The original study by textcite:peterson1996changing posits a relation between socioeconomic status and breadth of cultural tastes - or more precisely, openness to variety (p.904). 
# 
However, omnivorousness has become a rather blurry concept in itself:
# 
textcite:Sonnett_2016_ambivalence notes that next to the of volume of cultural consumption, it can refer to a range of concepts such as eclecticism, expertise, voraciousness and cosmopolitanism (p.39). 
#
Despite (or perhaps due to) its ambiguity, omnivorism has remained a key concept in characterizing cultural consumption. 
# 
While subjected to substantial criticism, parencite:coulangeon2007distinction,Warde_2008_omnivorous,Savage_2011_unravelling, this continued use has allowed theoretical advancements parencite:Warde_2008_omnivorous,Lizardo_2012_reconcept  without requiring the introduction of new typologies.  
# 
Particularly noteworthy is the notion of capturing the diversity of taste profile through an composition rather than an exclusive focus on the mere volume. 
# 
textcite:Lizardo_2014_holes therefore argues for a measure of "effective omnivorousness" that captures the "extent to which a person's cultural choices allow her to bridge across cultural worlds that are only weakly connected to one other or constrain her in a cultural network composed of redundant attachment to cultural forms with overlapping audiences" (p. 396). 
# 
Given the omnivorism of omnivorism with socio-economic status, it seems reasonable that genres that can attract omnivores fare better as the status of omnivores reflects back onto them. 
# 
*H_A1*: The more omnivorous a genre's audience is, the greater are its survival chances. 
#
# While omnivores do not have a strict ~dedication~ to any particular genre, they are reliant on the existence of genre boundaries which they can then span across. 


*** Taste for typicality
# 
textcite:Goldberg_2016_span integrate approaches from organizational and cultural and therefore take the properties of items into account (they employ much of the same terminology that has been used to elaborate concepts).[fn::This constitutes a key distinction from the conceptualization of omnivorism, which requires the choices by other audience members to estimate a individuals omnivorousness, whereas the taste for typicality can be deduced from chosen items' position in the feature space]
# 
Specifically they distinguish boundary /spanning/ (which is captured by the here employed notion of omnivorousness) from boundary /blurring/, which describes the extent to which objects adhere to established classification frameworks. 
# 
Audiences with a  preference for typical objects, the so-called purists, are argued to "play a boundary-policing role" (p.233). 
# 
It therefore seems reasonably to argue that genres increase their survival chances by the extent to which they can attract such a purist audience. 
#
*H_A2*: The more purist a genre's audience is, the greater are its survival chances. 


*** taste for popularity: still elaboration needed

  # implication: a genre is more likely to survive if it has an audience that likes popular stuff
  # but isn't it the other way around? a person that likes popular stuff is not going to listen to things that have a chance of dying out
  # could you say that if a genre manages to attract/capture people who only like popular stuff it is more likely to survive? 
  # hmm popularity -> survivavl definitely holds
  # but survival  -> popularity not necessarily: there are many things that exist that are not popular

# 
Audiences furthermore vary in the degree to which they value popularity parencite:Lieberson_2003_popularity,Kovacs_2014_paradox. 
# 
Such variation in second-order preferences parencite:Vaisey_2018_decision has been found to influence first names parencite:Lieberson_2003_popularity, song cite:Salganik_2008_herd and book ratings cite:Kovacs_2014_paradox. 
# 
Variation in taste for popularity has been found to produce fashion dynamics parencite:Zuckerman_2012_valuations
# 
[...]
# 
*H_A3*: The higher the taste for popularity of a genre's audiences, the higher are its chances of survival. 
# 

high TfP are ~conservative~: want general validation

It might be argued that the causal path runs in the other direction, as genres with a high taste for popularity only chose items of genres that are already established. 
# 
It is certainly true in a trivial sense as genres that have not survived are also not popular. 

However, numerous obscure genres exist which are unlikely to have an audience with a high taste for popularity, which seems to indicate that survival does not necessarily result in popularity. 







* questions (list of ideas with more or less relevance)

can i test prototype vs exemplar model? 
do they imply different mechanisms for survival? 

Piazzai doesn't even use word
- exemplar/prototype view
- *atypicality*
  Hannan: equivalent to informativeness
  is about relation between object and concept
  idc much about that relation

  
reflection (Lizardo)
if i make for each genre a "spread-score": how big the tension between genres is (low for heavy metal and black metal, higher for black metal and opera) -> can average that to the genre level


~is quillian part of the classical model?~ -> look up the source that Murphy cites, duh


*inclusion fallacy* against explicitly stored hierarchies (used by Murphy):  
- robin have X -> all birds have X more believable than robins have X -> ostriches have X
- can't see how that supports computed
- is typicality effect, but typicality can be considered in hierarchy
- maybe murphy didn't consider Hannan's view yet (argues against "logical reasoning")

Murphy sees typicality effects (birds have X -> robins/ostriches have X stronger for robins) as "greatest problem for pre-stored view"

"Findings of typicality effects, intransitivity of class inclusion, and evidence from RT experiments all pose problems for the stored hierarchy view" (p.209)

*** Hannan not that bad

concepts as probability distributions instead of points

concepts have spatial extent

*** Hannan bad
cite:Smith_1981_categories metric spaces bad (p.116)

Hannan: are subconcepts transitive? yup: p.55

c.) transitive: sub(c, c') \wedge sub(c' , c'') -> sub(c, c'').
that doesn't hold with furniture, chairs, car seats

fruit counterexample: 
fruit closest to item for 17/20 -> at least 8 dimensions needed (was actually re-analysis by Tversky)

omfg i'm so out of my area omfg
would have to read so much more cognitive science stuff fuuuuu

good insofar: against Quillian
also LSA bad

-> do i really want reduction to metric space?
